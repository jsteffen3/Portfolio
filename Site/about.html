                    I am a 22 year old graduate from James Madison University with a bachelors in Computer Science.
                    I have worked with programming and IT since I started high school. Most of my time working has been spent with Java and Python but,
                     I have also used other languages such as Rust, Ruby, C, JavaScript,
                     SQL and, Haskell. Most of my elective time was spent woking with web development but I also spent time doing UI development, IT and, process classes where
                     I learned how to work in an agile system and use version control such as Github.<br>
                    I am just as comforable working with others as I am by myself and am
                     able to quickly adapt to whatever is needed from me at the time. I am open to relocation for an opportunity and I am also able to work remotely if needed.
                     I am results oriented and have a strong drive to improve, have a positive outlook and don't shy away from a challenge. I'm looking for an organization
                     where I will be given the opportunity to advance and grow my skills.
