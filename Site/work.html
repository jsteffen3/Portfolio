                    This program will perform the functions of an affine cipher on the files you provide it. These are the functions it can do:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Encrypt will change the file you provide or create one based off your given A and B values into an encrpyted version.</li> 
                        <li>Derypt will change the file you provide or create one based off your give A and B values into a decrypted version.</li> 
                        <li>Decipher will take in your file and a dictionary file then it will attempt to determine the A and B values used to encode it.</li> <br>

                    This program will run a game similar to the old arcade game of the same name.<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>W, A, S and, D on your keyoard will move your spaceship. The spacebar will fire bullets.</li>
